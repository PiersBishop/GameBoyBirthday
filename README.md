# Game Boy Birthday
A small project I made for the GameBoy's 30 years anniversary.

The .gb file can be read with an emulator or put on a flash cart to be played on an actual Game Boy.
Don't forget to turn the sound on !

Made using the GBDK library. You will need to install it in order to compile.

The music player is mostly copy/pasted from code by scazon :
